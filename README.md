This notebook is my solution in the [Digital Green Crop Yield Estimate Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/digital-green-crop-yield-estimate-challenge) hosted by Zindi.<br/><br/>
The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning solution to predict rice crop yields in India. The goal is to empower these farmers and break the cycle of poverty and malnutrition.<br/><br/>
